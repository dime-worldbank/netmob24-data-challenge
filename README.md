This repo produced dataset for Netmob 2024 Data Challenge (https://netmob.org/). The NetMob 2024 Data Challenge offered an opportunity for researchers from various academic fields to extract and utilize insights from mobility data. This dataset, developed in collaboration with Cuebiq and generated from data provided by Cuebiq specifically for this Challenge, comprised privacy-preserving, aggregated datasets derived from mobile application data collected from users who voluntarily consented to anonymous data collection for research purposes. Beyond academic progress, the goal of this yearâ€™s challenge was to foster a global environment where enthusiasm for analyzing mobile phone data thrives alongside practical development objectives. Specifically, it targeted four countries in the Global South (i.e., Colombia, Indonesia, India, and Mexico), aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals.
